# Unit 2: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

This unit focuses on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a class of deep neural networks commonly used in computer vision tasks. You'll learn about their architecture, components, and how to implement them for various vision applications.

## Topics Covered

- CNN architecture and basic building blocks
- Convolution operations and their properties
- Pooling layers and their purpose
- Common CNN architectures (LeNet, AlexNet, VGG, ResNet)
- Training and evaluating CNNs
- Transfer learning with pre-trained CNNs

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the fundamentals of convolutional neural networks
- Implement and train CNN models for image classification
- Apply transfer learning using pre-trained CNN models
- Visualize and interpret CNN features
- Evaluate CNN performance on computer vision tasks

## Assignments

The assignments directory contains hands-on exercises to help you gain practical experience with CNNs:

1. **CNN Basics**: Building a simple CNN for image classification
2. **Transfer Learning**: Fine-tuning pre-trained CNN models
3. **CNN Visualization**: Visualizing and interpreting CNN features

Each assignment includes a partially completed Python file with `# TODO:` sections for you to fill in, guiding you through the implementation and understanding of key concepts.
