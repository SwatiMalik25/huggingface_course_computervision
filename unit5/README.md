# Unit 5: Generative Models

This unit explores generative models in computer vision, which can create new visual content based on learned patterns. The focus is on state-of-the-art models like Diffusion Models and others that have revolutionized image generation capabilities.

## Topics Covered

- Introduction to generative models in computer vision
- Key architectures: GANs, VAEs, and Diffusion Models
- Training and sampling from generative models
- Text-to-image generation
- Image-to-image translation
- Controllable generation with conditioning
- Evaluation of generative models

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the principles behind different generative model architectures
- Learn how diffusion models work and why they're effective
- Implement and use pre-trained generative models
- Generate images from text descriptions
- Explore techniques for controlled generation
- Evaluate the quality of generated images

## Assignments

The assignments directory contains hands-on exercises to help you understand and work with generative models:

1. **Diffusion Models**: Understanding and using diffusion models for image generation
2. **Text-to-Image Generation**: Generating images from text descriptions
3. **Image Editing**: Using generative models for controlled image editing

Each assignment includes a partially completed Python file with `# TODO:` sections for you to fill in, guiding you through the implementation and application of generative models.
