# Unit 4: Multimodal Models

This unit explores multimodal models that can process and understand multiple types of data, with a focus on vision-language models that combine both visual and textual information.

## Topics Covered

- Introduction to multimodal learning
- Vision-language models and their architectures
- CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training)
- Image-text embedding spaces
- Zero-shot and few-shot capabilities of multimodal models
- Applications of vision-language models

## Learning Objectives

- Understand how multimodal models combine different types of data
- Learn the architecture and training methodology of CLIP
- Implement and use pre-trained vision-language models
- Explore the image-text embedding space
- Apply multimodal models to various tasks like image classification, retrieval, and generation

## Assignments

The assignments directory contains hands-on exercises to help you understand and work with multimodal models:

1. **CLIP Basics**: Understanding and using CLIP for zero-shot classification
2. **Image-Text Retrieval**: Implementing image retrieval from text queries and vice versa
3. **Multimodal Applications**: Applying multimodal models to solve practical problems

Each assignment includes a partially completed Python file with `# TODO:` sections for you to fill in, guiding you through the implementation and application of multimodal models.
